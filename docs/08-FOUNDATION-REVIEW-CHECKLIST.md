## Resolved Blocking Decision

### Order vs Delivery state authority

ADR-007 is ACCEPTED with **Option A — Strict separation**.

- Order owns commercial state through READY_FOR_PICKUP.
- Delivery owns assignment and fulfillment state.
- Delivery is the sole mutable source of truth for driver/pickup/transit/completion state.
- Customer-facing order views may compose Order + Delivery without duplicating mutable fulfillment state.

This removes the previous overlap between Order and Delivery.

## Foundation Exit Criteria

- One state authority is documented: PASS.
- Lifecycle transition tables are consistent: PASS.
- RED tests are the next verification artifact: READY.
- Aggregate transaction/concurrency rules are implementable: PASS WITH M0 IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL OPEN.
- API contract can be derived without ambiguous state ownership: PASS.
- No production feature code depends on unresolved domain semantics: PASS.

## Remaining M0 Design Work

These are implementation details, not foundation blockers:
1. Transaction boundary for READY_FOR_PICKUP and Delivery creation.
2. Delivery creation/assignment semantics.
3. Customer-facing composed status/read model.
4. Cancellation and Delivery FAILED semantics.
5. Concrete persistence mappings and concurrency strategy.

These must be resolved in the relevant M0 design/test artifacts before their implementation.

## Next Step

Begin TDD RED for Create Order, then build the first vertical slice end-to-end.
